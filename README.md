# tilerec
Simple program to identify and extract unique tiles from an image

I wrote this to extract tiles/sprites from screenshots of 8-bit games. It was also written in 3 languages (PHP, Java, Python) as a learning project.

Improvements would consist of better color depth handling and outputting different tile sizes.

![Screenshot](/screenshot.png?raw=true "Screenshot")

This is just an example - if you were going to use this to actually rip sprites from a screenshot, you would want to only enable a single layer of sprites or tiles in the emulator to avoid mixing characters and backgrounds.
