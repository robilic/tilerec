# tilerec
Simple program to identify and extract unique tiles from an image

I wrote this to extract tiles/sprites from screenshots of 8-bit games. It was also written in 3 languages (PHP, Java, Python) as a learning project.

Improvements would consist of better color depth handling and outputting different tile sizes.
